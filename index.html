			<p>As fitness expert Amanda Russell said:</p>
			<blockquote>Fitness is about so much more than exercise. Itâ€™s a catalyst for positive change, and it affects
				every aspect of your life.</blockquote>

			<h3>What We Offer</h3>

			<h3><a href="strength/index.html">Build strong muscles</a></h3>
			<p>Tired of being tired? Strength training can help you manage or lose weight and increase your metabolism
				to help you burn more calories. It can also increase bone density and reduce the risk of osteoporosis.
			</p>

			<h3><a href="cardio/index.html"> Get Your Heart Rate Up</a></h3>
			<p>Want to lose weight? Cardiovascular exercise burns calories and improves overall health. It can reduce
				belly fat, promote brain growth, prevent stress, and help you focus.</p>

			<h3><a href="stress/index.html">Relax</a></h3>
			<p>Stressed out? Stress can weaken the immune system and cause high blood pressure, fatigue, depression,
				anxiety, and even heart disease. Learn ways to manage and reduce stress.</p>

			<h3><a href="diet/index.html">Eat what's right for you</a></h3>
			<p>Are you really what you eat? Lose weight, gain weight, or just feel great! Maintaining a healthy diet is
				probably the most important thing you can do to promote overall health.</p>

			<h2>How to prepare to Shape Up!</h2>
			<h3>Get a check up</h3>
			<p>If you have any health issues or take any medications, be sure to consult with your healthcare provider before beginning a new exercise or diet regimen.</p>

			<h3>Dress for Success</h3>
			<p>Workout clothes should be comfy. While exercising, you should be thinking about what you're doing, not what you're wearing. That includes good shoes, which are essential for running, jogging, or walking, and socks that absorb shock and sweat.</p>

			<h2>Equipment?</h2>
			<p>You don't need to buy a lot of fancy equipment to get in shape. But you might want to invest in a yoga mat, a large exercise ball, or some weights, depending on your Shape Up! plan.</p>

			<h2>Resist Temptation</h2>
			<p>It's hard to eat right when everyone else is buying lunch at a fast food restaurant. Invest in some good food containers and bring your healthy lunch and snacks. Your body and your wallet will thank you.</p>
